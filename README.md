Paper Manager is a Joomla 3 extension allowing the management of scientific publications. The extension is useful for websites related to research laboratories and organizations. Lists of scientific papers are commonly present in such websites. A single paper can be included in more than one of these lists. For example it can be shown on a page dedicated to the conference publications of the lab and also on the profile pages of the authors. Paper Manager allows a specific paper entry to be displayed on multiple pages without copying html code on all the relative articles. The extension consists of a component and a content plugin. The component is used for CRUD operations on papers, paper categories and authors while the plugin displays lists of papers inside content (ex. articles), using special code snippets.
